Panoramic Image Stitching Tool – Requirements Specification

Purpose:

This tool takes four input images and produces a single stitched output image,
with seamless transitions between the source images.

Functional Requirements:

Input Handling

[FR-01] Accept exactly four input images.

[FR-02] Support standard image formats (e.g. JPG, PNG, BMP).

[FR-03] All input images must have the same resolution.

[FR-04] Optional input: calibration data (intrinsics, distortion, orientation).

Preprocessing

[FR-05] Apply lens distortion correction if parameters are provided.

[FR-06] Rectify or project each image (e.g. perspective, cylindrical).

[FR-07] Allow user-defined camera orientations/positions.

Stitching and Blending

[FR-08] Determine image overlap from configuration or estimates.

[FR-09] Align images using:
a. Predefined transformation matrices OR
b. Feature-based matching (e.g. ORB/SIFT).

[FR-10] Blend overlapping regions using:
a. Feathering
b. Multiband blending
c. Exposure matching (optional)

Output

[FR-11] Produce a single stitched image as output.

[FR-12] Output image must have smooth visual transitions (no seams).

[FR-13] Support exporting as PNG, JPG (at minimum).

[FR-14] Allow configurable output resolution.

Non-Functional Requirements:

[NFR-01] Support 4K inputs with < 60 sec processing time (reference desktop).

[NFR-02] Compatible with desktop and embedded platforms.

[NFR-03] Configuration via external file (e.g. JSON, YAML).

[NFR-04] Toggle processing stages via config flags.

[NFR-05] Modular design (input → transform → align → blend → output).

[NFR-06] Scalable to more than 4 input images.

Testing and Validation:

[TST-01] Provide test cases with synthetic alignment patterns.

[TST-02] Validate real image stitching with visible overlap accuracy.

[TST-03] Log diagnostics for alignment and blending quality.

Optional/Advanced Features:

[OPT-01] Integrate deep learning (e.g. flow-based or UNet-style models).

[OPT-02] GPU acceleration (OpenCV CUDA or Vulkan).

[OPT-03] Interactive GUI or preview interface.

[OPT-04] Batch processing mode for multiple sets of images.

Summary:

A modular, configurable stitching pipeline that ingests four aligned or calibratable images,
warps and blends them into a seamless panoramic image, and exports the result in standard formats.
